# SUBLIME-TEMPLATE

## What Is Sublime
 [SUBLIME][original template page] is a Creative HTML5 one-page template designed for creative agencies, studios, digital 
 design and media agencies. The template is a dark theme design with 
 features like fullscreen header/hero section, responsive video lightbox, a nice portfolio section 
 and much more.

### What I Did (Sep 23, 2021)
 I rebult the [Sublime template][original template page] with Scss and HTML, using its [psd file] and also I took some measurements from the [original template demo].
 ### Add Js (Nov 23, 2021)
 I added js files, now the site is more interactive.
