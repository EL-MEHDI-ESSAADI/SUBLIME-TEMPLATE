# SUBLIME-TEMPLATE

## What Is Sublime
 SUBLIME is a Creative HTML5 one-page template designed for creative agencies , studios, digital 
 design and media agencies or other similar business by styleshout. The template is a dark theme design with 
 features like fullscreen header/hero section, responsive video lightbox, a nice portfolio section 
 and much more. The template is primarily designed for creative agencies but it is versatile enough 
 to be used for other purposes like a landing page for your startup or business website.
